## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

\newpage 

$$f(x) = \begin{cases} x & x>5\\-x & x<5\end{cases}$$

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be
  
  
- list 1  
- list 2  

    + sub 1  
    + sub 2  
    
        * sub 3?  
        * sub 4?  
            
            - list 5  
            
                1. hey
 


generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
#create summary of the cars data set 
summary(cars)
```


```{r}

```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:        

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot. `r dim(iris)`, `r dim(cars)`
